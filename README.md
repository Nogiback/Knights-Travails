# Knights-Travails

[Javascript - Knights Travails Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails)

The purpose of this project was to create a program that finds the shortest path for a knight to get from one square to another on a typical 8x8 chess board. The program will utilize a data structure to store all the possible movements a knight can traverse. A search algorithm will then determine the shortest possible path the knight can make to get from position A to position B (user input).
